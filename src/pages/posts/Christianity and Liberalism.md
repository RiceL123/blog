> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity): **Liberal Christianity**, also known as **Liberal Theology** and historically as **Christian Modernism**, is a movement that interprets Christian teaching by taking into consideration modern knowledge, science and ethics. It emphasizes the importance of reason and experience over doctrinal authority. Liberal Christians view their theology as an alternative to both atheistic rationalism and theologies based on traditional interpretations of external authority, such as the Bible or sacred tradition.

From what I understand, *before reading* the book, theological liberalism (not to be confused with political liberalism) is what occurs when one's world does not align with what the scripture actually says and elevates the status of man + lowers the status of God. As such, instead of either humbling themselves to orthodoxy or leaving Christianity, they instead try to find a middle ground continuing to claim themselves as Christians while twisting the Word so that it fits into their own world view. - At a point in time in my life this may have been me (though not to the extreme end), though I currently understand that I am not a Christian. From my understanding theological liberalism is typically characterized by universalism / potential universalism, along with the extreme end like denying God's authorship of the Bible or LGBTQ affirming churches like the Uniting Church of Australia.

One of the most terrifying verses in the Bible is [[Matthew]] 7:21; "*Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.*". I am worried that people may believe themselves to be 'Christian' yet instead adopt a theologically liberal view that is opposed to the essentials of the faith. Clarity in thought is vital and I believe it would be better for one to deny being a Christian rather than continue as a wolf in sheep's clothing.

## Introduction

What is *liberalism* or *modernism*? It a movement / school of thought that is rooted in the denial of any power of a creator God which directly opposes Christianity

How did liberalism come about? Liberalism comes about with the thrust of the scientific method and scepticism modern times. Especially with things like the industrial revolution which can be seen everywhere and uprooting of false teachings from the past like the geocentric model and what not, one simply cannot ignore the truthfulness of the scientific method. Here in the present we have no other teachings apart from those of Christianity that hold its authority in 1st-century teachings which begs the question if this modern era of scientific thought can coexist with a 2000 year old religion.

Liberalism tries to make 'peace' with scientific thought and Christianity by taking things that are 'unscientific' like Jesus' death and resurrection and painting them instead as symbols which point to the 'true essence of Christianity' which is just a guide for utilitarianism. Yet it is obvious that in denying things like the resurrection, there is no 'peace' and orthodoxy has been lost. Liberalism, to put is lightly, is un-Christian and if true Christianity is to remain steadfast, it might push back against this infiltration.
## Chapter 1: Doctrine

Liberal ideologies are not limited to people purposefully trying to twist Christianity, but seep into sermons, Sunday school classes, bible studies and universities. In **fear** of being offensive not only to the world but other Christians at times, the full truth is withheld at times. Liberalism tries to make the point that teachings / doctrine is to have good morals and that events that took place were are just metaphors whenever something opposes their own view. Jesus, to them, is comparable to Confucius.

So when are to discern whether or not something is 'Christian', we must go origins of the faith where its doctrines were established. By looking at the Bible, it is evident that it is rooted in historic events like the death and resurrection of Jesus and the spreading of the religion by the disciples from Jerusalem into the gentile world. Of the first Christian generation included Paul, who had many teachings about the character of the movement. In fact, Paul was so dedicated to doctrine that even when some had preached "*Christ out of envy and rivalry*" ([[Philippians]] 1:15), he only cared that **correct doctrine**, that **truth** was taught; [[Philippians]] 1:18 "*But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice.*". And on the contrapositive, Paul states in [[Galatians]] 1:8 "*But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you, let them be under God’s curse!*". Christianity has its foundations in doctrine; the two cannot be separated. In the primitive Church, the history was always connected with its meaning, the doctrine.

| history | doctrine |
| --- | ---|
| Christ died | for our sins |
| Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried | he descended to hell |
| The third day he rose again from the dead | He ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty
(I guess one would try to argue that that resurrection was not history but you get what I'm tryna say)

So we've established that doctrine is central to Christianity. So what are the doctrines of the faith? Well, we can have look at the teachings of Jesus Christ. Liberalism will say, Jesus taught in [[Mark]] 12:31 'Love your neighbour as yourself' which is of course biblical yet will say that was all He had to say and somehow practically forget the most important commandment in verse just before it (verse 30); 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your should and with all your mind and with all your strength'. Not only did Jesus teach this, he also claimed to be God ([[John]] 10:30, [[John]] 8:58, [[Revelation]] 22:13) and our saviour ([[2 Peter]] 1:1, [[Mark]] 10:45). Jesus clearly indicates that His doctrine is not just a metaphor and that not only should we trust His teachings but truth Him for our salvation.

Then comes the argument that **the scriptures themselves are unreliable** as we are living 2000 years past the time of Jesus. With this disconnect, liberalism claims that only practical means of connecting is in a spectator view of Jesus as a past figure rather than one that is living and reigning now with whom which a relationship can be made. Yet to adopt this view is to place oneself in the desperate, gloomy period of the three days between Jesus' death and resurrection. One can speak of reverence of Jesus' character and the history, yet to trust He loves you and died for you requires faith in the doctrine which is core to Christianity.

Not only is the doctrines that Jesus teaches is important, but also the teachings of the apostles, the council of Nicaea and Athanasius. They build on each other and to deny them would be to deny what they are based off of.

What then are differences of opinion that can held? If loyalty is to Bible and the ecumenical creeds, then these differences can be held while we live as apart of the one holy catholic and apostolic church. This is not to say that theological differences is a unimportant manner. When considering different point of views, they should be analysed with the big picture in mind. Does this view have sufficient biblical evidence? Does it ultimately does it come down to a lack of faith?

One of the disputable matters Mechan brings up is the Lord's supper. As it says in [[Luke]] 22:19-20 "*And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” 20 And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.*" In regards to what Jesus had said, 'this **is**', there are varying beliefs on how the bread and wine turn into the blood and body of Christ and whether that means it happens physically, spiritually or if it is purely a metaphor to do 'in remembrance of' Christ. The opinion it is purely a metaphor is a 'liberal' idea in the sense that it tries to bridge the two facts that Jesus said 'is' and that the bread and wine doesn't physically show any change in taste, looks or smell. 'Liberal' ideas can be found everywhere with some being fine and other being outrageously heretical and so critical discernment must be made to when trying to interpret the scriptures in order to stay true to orthodoxy.

At the heart of Christianity is truth.
