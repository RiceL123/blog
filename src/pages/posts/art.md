- I need to try avoid zooming in to the canvas and getting caught up on the details - you don't need to perfectly colour in between the lines.
- Use references if u want ig
- Eyes go in the middle of the head. Distance between the eyes should be 1 eye. Distance from eyebrow to nose = nose to chin.
- Shadows do not need to be black. When shading, the hue can be changed like using more orangey colours for skin shading light still bounces onto shadows
- Objects should reflect the light of the environment even if it isn't a mirror. Clouds aren't white, trees aren't green. A base colour can be set and the environment colours should be glazed on
- Eyes should be drawn in perspective. Draw the pupil inside the iris like its at the bottom of a hole
- From upper angle ears are higher than the eyes and from lower angle, ears are lower than the eyes
- From the lower angle the chin will become more flat or even taper upwards
- Eyes brows can be used to shown expression in the face as is with the shoulders for the body
- Hands can be broken down to a box + 5 thick lines. You can also trace your own hand. The tip of the finger should curve from the finger pad to the nail
- The edge between shadow and no shadow can have a saturated colour
- The shoulder, wrist and elbow can be mapped first so that humerus (shoulder to elbow) and ulna/radius (elbow to wrist) are kept the same length
- The human mind is able to fill in a lot of details. A lot can be conveyed with a few strokes. The ear is suffice with 2 lines
- Having breaks between lines, squishing the face closer to the chin, rounding the cheeks and removing clothing wrinkles can make your work more cute
- Make the subject of the photo (usually the face) more detailed relative to the rest of the image
- A foot is around the same size as the face, chibi characters look good with big shoes
- Long hair can be thought of as a bunch of flowy ribbons
- Hair draping over the face can use lower opacity / be airbrushed with the colour of the skin to make it more 3D
- Try drawing the body before the clothes, the skull before the hair
- When winking the eyelid goes down so the base of the open eye aligns with the closed eye
- Mouths should give the illusion of depth by the shape of the shadows or teeth
- For sideward face angles, the eye further away can be cut off by the nose / eyelid/lashes
- Anime faces are more cat like rather than human like; the nose doesn't dip back after extruding, instead the tip of the nose to the chin can is connected by a straight line
- Don't try to force a picture to look good. Draw for fun and if the sketch looks decent consider taking it further if you wish
- Traditional art can make you more confident with your strokes
