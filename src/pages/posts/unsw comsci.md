I am now in my 3rd year at UNSW doing a bachelors of computer science (3778). Overall, I think it has been a great degree in what it teaches.

Nearly all the required courses are useful, albeit the math ones and the plethora of CS electives makes it possible to come out of university as a quite well-rounded programmer without needing too much self-study if you choose the good ones. I may seem like I'm glazing, but my evaluation is in comparison to courses like philosophy or business where the number of relevant / useful courses pale in comparison to the UNSW CS degree which doesn't force you to do random science or literature courses. That being said, it is still very possible to half ass your courses or poorly choose courses but by talking with older students, checking course reviews and being somewhat diligent, you should be okay.

Although you can become a decent programmer especially with exam style questions, I believe the degree lacks in teaching building/ deploying apps and reading documentation which is are important skills to have.

## My UNI career
### 22 T1
#### COMP1511 Programming Fundamentals: 85
COMP1511 is a great introduction to programming. It teaches not only how to use the basic techniques like loops, conditional statements, arrays, structs and pointers in C but also the underlying mechanisms of memory, pointers and malloc. It gives you a solid foundation as a programmer. The weekly exercises and assignments are all curated to help you learn by doing them. Might be one of the best cs courses.
#### MATH1081 Discrete Mathematics: 57
Discrete math has a focus proofs and reasoning and what not. Being in my first term, I was having too much fun focusing my attention to COMP1511 and trying survive living alone that I didn't watch any lectures or attend any tutorials. Only doing MATH AA SL in high school plus my negligence set me on the path to failure, but luckily it had some generous pre exam marks up for grabs and the final exam was online so I was NOT able to get some help. Overall, it seemed like it could've been an interesting course if I actually tried to learn but still is useless in regards to my career as a programmer.
#### MATH1131 Mathematics 1A: 70
Similar to Discrete Math, I ignored this subject's tutorials and lectures leading to my own demise however, the topics were more similar to that which I already learnt in high school. Additionally, once I had grasped the math program, Maple, things became a lot more smooth sailing. All in all, a useless required subject.

### 22 T2
Overall my worst term as I had a sick with covid and another illness back to back. Prolly lost the most weigh in my life in the period of time.
#### COMP1521 Computer Systems Fundamentals: 69
This course was split into 2 parts; the MIPS assembly part and the C part. Learning assembly was great in helping my understanding of the inner workings of how software works. The C programming part of the course just felt like natural progression from COMP1511. Although I was sick for most of this term causing me to miss out of assignments and content, the things that I do remember from the course have been very helpful.
#### COMP2041 Software Construction: 66
This may have been the hardest course for me as a first year. It is split into 2 sections, the shell scripting part and the python part. The shell scripting part which included unix, regex and sh and whatnot was very difficult. However, I learnt of the core things it takes to be a good developer like understanding errors and reading the docs. The python section just seemed more like an introduction to python which was still very helpful. Being crushed by this course so early in my programming career helped me develop my skills a lot quicker.
#### MATH1231 Mathematics 1B: 70
Very similar to MATH 1B. I did felt no enjoyment taking this course just trying to be proficient at Maple so I neglected lectures and tutorials. I took a gamble for the final exam to only study like 2 topics and a good portion of the final happened cover those topics so I got lucky there.

### 22 T3
#### COMP2521 Data Structures and Algorithms: 87
This was a pretty good course and my first time underloading. As such, I was able to focus solely on it and do quite well. Though the topics of trees, graphs and sorting were quite interesting, Being in C, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of various data structures like hash maps though in interviews I would probably prefer python or js. It felt like all I had learnt by the end of the course was how to code in an exam environment regurgitating dfs or whateva. Not my favourite course.

### 23 T1
#### COMP3311 Database Systems: 82
A very nice course on database systems focused on PostgreSQL. The assignments using raw SQL and python which wrapped to it were good. Though my querying was able to improving, I lacked the knowledge of deploying or setting my own database. So, I would have to learn this on my own to utilize the acquired querying knowledge.

#### COMP1531 Software Eng Fundamentals: 99
My best course mark by a long shot. It is a group project where you develop the backend of a chat app going through multiple iterations learning typescript and various backend things like HTTP requests and unit tests. Luckily I had a great team and as 1531 more lengthy rather than difficult, we were able to get a lot of things done. For this term specifically, we did not have an exam but an iteration 4 where you would implement a bonus feature. I rewrote the database using SQLite3 as a means to apply the knowledge I had learnt in 3311 which was great for learning. Probably one of the best courses because of my team and its structure for this term which helped me learn a lot.

### 23 T2
#### COMP2511 O-O Design & Programming: 73
I really do not care about object oriented design or Java; I would rather use C# (i've never used C#). I strongly felt that for the complexity of the tasks, a lot of the design principles enforced were unnecessary and ineffective at explaining its usefulness. I could write a clean solution in 2 files and like 200 less lines however, for *extensibility* even though I knew the scope of the problem, I was forced to separate things to like 7 files with a lot more code. I didnt watch like any of the lectures but maybe I would've been convinced of OOP usefulness otherwise. Overall, its a good course because you get learn OOP which is useful since a lot of API's and other code you interact with takes this approach. However, the overbearing enforced principles like Liskov substitution principle and Demeter seem useless.
#### COMP3331 Computer Networks & Applications: 80
This course was too theoretical as only coding that was done was for the assignment. However, the assignment on making a recursive DNS resolver was great. I was reading the documentation for the RFC-1035 and doing a good bit of coding. In fact, the code was complex enough that I was able to appreciate how an OOP approach could have been more elegant than my functional approach more than I was able to appreciate the OOP in 2511. Though we learnt about the various network layers and things like UDP and TCP, I feel like I do not know how to code sockets and the like as my knowledge is just theory.

### 23 T3
####  COMP3121 Algorithms & Programming Tech: 81
This course has no coding in it. I guess it was helpful in showing the theory of different techniques like dynamic programming and Edmons-Karp. With all the knowledge I learnt and the syntax for formatting an explanation of an algorithms correctness and time complexity, I can't use none of it since I lack the knowledge to code it.

####  COMP6080 Web Front End Programming: 88
Probably one of the best courses learning basic html, css and js along with some React at the end. It walks you through making some static sites with vanilla javascript so you can appreciate the functionality of React. You were also allowed to use various css frameworks exposing me to things like bootstrap, material ui and tailwind. It was such a well rounded courses and as soon as you are finished with it, you are able to start making client side rendered apps immediately. Very practical and useful.

### 24 T1
####  COMP3231 Operating Systems:
####  COMP6991 Modern Prog Problems with Rust:
