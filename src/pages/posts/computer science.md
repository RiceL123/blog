- If I were a class, I would define you in my constructor class so we'd be tightly coupled
- Are you a function, cuz I wanna call you

# Computer Science
I thought computer science seemed like a fun thing to do around late grade 11. Although it was a subject offered at [[QASMT]], I couldn't take it because by the time I realize how cool it seemed cuz I was already locked with HL Physics finals already started T-T being in the same boat as Justin

Before, I really did have any direction in what I wanted as my career path. However, I saw computer science - and just thought *'this seems cool enough for me'*. So I didn't have to study for ucat (the exam for med students) and could focus on my IB landing me here with ZERO prior coding knowledge and doing it in uni.

At [[UNSW]] computer science, we learn a language called C. I'm finding pretty fun so far.

computer science problem solving
Idk i heard that computer science was a lot about problem solving and the way coders solve problems is idk different? something u kinda like pick up

Idk maybe im starting to understand it? Lets say i have a math question/ physics question or whateva you know the standard where there is a definite answer/ no subjectivity. The thought process is goes like
1. Interpret question so that you know what tools/formulas u wanna apply
2. apply the tools/formula (since u've used these tools/formulae applying correctly = always correct)
3. Done

> In high school maths and physics you never know your right or wrong until you check your answers. So the methods that u remember and employ take you from point A (interpreted question) to point B (an answer). The philosophy of problem solving is just using the right method in a given situation making it a very 0 or 100 vibe


With computer science its basically the same. However, just with extra steps cuz like you dont know if you are applying the tools/formulae correctly. As a result
1. Interpret question so that you know what functions u wanna apply
2. think of an easy problem to code first and then run that
3. if it runs correctly then make another problem that one step closer to the solution and continue to solve and test
4. Done

> With coding, the problem solving makes you break down things to smaller problems because if u try to do everything all at once and it doesn't work the first time, it a massive pain to debug. So, yeah less of a 0 or 100 vibe and more of a can you solve your own problem which is a step towards the real problem. idk
