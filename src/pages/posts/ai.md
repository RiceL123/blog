AI is cool and all

but the peak of ai does not surpass that of human mind. It is only able to function as an average of the what the humans have given it


My worry for humans is that they will not trust themselves and become over reliant on AI. I want you, whoever you may be, to please trust in yourself and your own capabilites.
