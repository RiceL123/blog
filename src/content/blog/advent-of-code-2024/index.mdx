## The challenge
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a 25 day challenge of language agnostic problems for the month of December in the lead up to Christmas. Being language agnostic, the problems can be solved by any means necessary including by hand, on LibreOffice Calc, with Sratch or with a programming language.

I decided that for 2024, I would try and have a crack trying a different language for each day:

import Languages from './Languages.astro';

<Languages />

You can find all of my solutions in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RiceL123/advent-of-code).
## Visualizing language usage
[GitHub](https://github.com) will automatically generate the language distribution in a repository according to [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/) to generate a HTML span like the one below.

import GitHubLangs from './GitHubLangs.astro'

<GitHubLangs />

Although this fulfils my intented purpose, when too many languages are used in a single repo, infomation on some of them are aggregated into one single 'Other' category. As such, I would need to manually show the language usage myself walking through the specific directory and using the file size.

Initially, I wrote a [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) script that would generate the HTML element on every commit with a GitHub workflow. Using a JSON file that was a subset [linguist's yaml file](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) worked as intended, however, GitHub's README.md files do not render raw HTML.

So, my next idea was to redraw an image that the README.md file would reference in order to automatically update the language distribution on each commit. I decided to use python and learn a little bit of [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to generate the language distribution in a doughnut graph.

This script was a perfectly acceptable however, the arbitrary ordering of the [globing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html) and thus language distribution did get on my nerves so much so that I had to cave into the scope creep; I decided that I would need to sort the languages based on **colour**.

#### Sorting the Languages by Colour
Initially I tried to sort the colours by their [hue](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue#Defining%20hue%20in%20terms%20of%20RGB)
```js
let hue = Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(3) * (G - B), (2 * R - G - B))
```
---
import HueDraft from './HueDraft.astro'

<HueDraft />
This worked well expect for colours that were [achromatic](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic) (whereby `r == g == b`). The hue function would break down for these languages (Crystal and C) and so I needed another dimension for sorting.

Two methods were considered for this extra dimension, [luminance](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance) and [value / lightness](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightness).
```js
let luminance = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B
let value = Math.max(R, G, B)
```

import HueLuminance from './HueLuminance.astro'

<HueLuminance />

Looking at the two outputs, the vibes for luminance were just better because as a human, [colour temperature](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature) is an important factor that value seems to not care about.

import ColorScatter from './ColorScatter.astro'

<ColorScatter />

Though I now had 2 dimensions to sort the colours, the language distribution was only in 1 dimension. So, I decided that I would just find the grays and blacks and chuck them next to the colour of lowest luminance. This produced the final image:

<Image alt="language distribution" width="630" height="630" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiceL123/advent-of-code/main/script/2024.svg" style="margin-inline: auto;"/>

If more robust colour sorting is wanted in the future, I think I would use both the hue and luminance in my calculation to get to a 2D plot and from there do some [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) to sort them in 1 dimension.

The GitHub workflow script can be found [here](https://github.com/RiceL123/advent-of-code/blob/main/script/readme.py) in the same aoc repo. If you know of a way to hide the commits of the [github actions user](https://github.com/actions-user) please let me know!

## The Languages
Most languages have their specific use cases where they flourish. I will be judging them based on *✨vibes✨* according to my experience solving the advent of code problems.
Some criteria that I would like met when using a programming language include:
- Easy to read and write (should be close to english or common language patterns)
- Good documentation (I will try avoid tutorials and head straight to the docs)
- Quick installation and setup (if I can't make it a simple [shebangable](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) script at least make it a simple `cargo new` or equivalent)
- Helpful error messages ([Code completion](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_completion) is nice as well)
- I don't want to be fighting the language or compiler, i want to be fighting the problem at hand
- **Other requirements**: functional paradigm support, lambdas, destructuring, types or type hints
### Day 01: [Haskell](https://haskell.org/)
I took a course at uni on Haskell with a terrible professor as my first introduction to pure functional programming. Although assignments were released weeks after they should have been, I still found this new way of thinking and expanding my mind to be satisfying (though some of more mathy concepts flew right over my head). Using the IO monad and the simplicity of day01's problem made this a pleasant experience. Additionally, resources like Hoogle were lovely to work with.
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Haskell.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Haskell.icon} filename={aoc24_languages.Haskell.file}/>
TLDR: Its cool paradigm but I don't why I actively choose to use it in real world applications
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Haskell.file} lang="haskell" />
### Day 02: [Lua](https://lua.org/)
There was a lot of hype around Lua. All the youngings be using it for roblox and I also see it in neovim and other random places. Very easy to setup
It was good but I would prefer some more batteries included if you know what i mean. It was really easy to setup very nice

<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Lua.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Lua.icon} />

### Day 10: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript)
Javascript so nice to use when making simple things. Did this challenge in the airport very nice
might be one of my fav implementations of functional
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.JavaScript.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.JavaScript.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.JavaScript.file} lang="js" />
### Day 11: [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
I'm not too familiar with dp, so I fell back onto a language i was familiar with as a safe guard
Only later did i directly translate this code to scala. It was a pretty simple process. Love that scala supports functional style programs
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Scala.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Scala.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Scala.file} lang="scala" />

TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Rust.file} lang="rust" />
### Day 13: [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/)
Ruby is great. When doing some arithmetic, the numbers seemed to be stored as quotients and so I had no floating point errors. It was amazing! Syntatically simple pre nice
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Ruby.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Ruby.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Ruby.file} lang="ruby" />
### Day 14: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
There was a lot of hype of
Documentation feels
For some reason vscode IntelliSense not working. All goods cuz it works on Zed with the click of a button

First day of zig not really liking it. Second day of zig liking it a lot more. The learning curve was pretty steepish but after the initial curve pretty lit i reckon

Needa give Zig some time to marinate. Would probably only go back to it if it passes v1.0

I love how the problem is just like 'find the christmas tree that'll appear' without any clear deterministic instructions or examples
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Zig.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Zig.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Zig.file} lang="zig" />
### Day 15: [Python](https://python.org/)
Bruh zig had me so demotivated
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Python.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Python.icon} />
TLDR: Python goated i like the zen of python philosophy by brackets >> indents
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Python.file} lang="python" />
### Day 16: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
Hate how difficult it was just to find the cli compiler like bro i don't want your IDE mate. Bruh binary is just like 200MB and its a pain to setup and run and just running hello world i needa install even more dependencies?? The compilation times are outrageously slow

Doesn't have a standard file system? Maybe its cuz its tryna target multiple platforms - gleam as well?? Wow turns out if i want to just java functions, i can't use the kotlin native compiler but need the jvm compiler?? However, you can't have both the native and jvm compiler as it just default to the native compiler 😠. bruh ofc imma click on the linux one if i see it [there](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

Kotlin doesn't have a priority queue or min-heap. All goods because I can just drop in the java priority queue which is pretty cool

<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Kotlin.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Kotlin.icon} />
TLDR: Worst language in terms of setup. Would only use if I had Intellij
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Kotlin.file} lang="kotlin" />
### Day 17: [Dart](https://dart.dev)
why does apt-get take 4 steps???? bruh imma just download the binary (bruh its like 200 MB as well) (takes less steps lmao)
bruh why is analytics opt-out and not opt-in. typically google ig 💀
overall pretty nice language, shebangable, destructuring and what not pretty mid nothing too good nothing too bad
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Dart.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Dart.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Dart.file} lang="dart" />
### Day 18: [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
Very easy download only taking like 7 mb and easy to pick up syntatically
Functional
shebangable lovely (gives me gleam vibes)
Lmao i've like never seen these vscode colours for keywords before (i just use the default theme cuz i'm a simple guy)
functional bfs is kinda based - I looked up a recusive solution and it didn't seem too bad. However, instead of copying it, I wanted to try and do an unfold

Didn't really understand unfold so played aroud in iex for a bit. Also very nice
docs are pretty good

Overall really liked it:

TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Elixir.file} lang="elixir" />
### Day 19: [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/)
Squirrel prolly one of the most obscure languages on this list
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Squirrel.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Squirrel.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Squirrel.file} lang="squirrel" />
### Day 20: [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
Nim was nice as to code in. I really liked
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Nim.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Nim.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Nim.file} lang="nim" />
### Day 21: [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
Crystal is ruby like language -
documentation is awesome
some error messages not that helpful
has functional features lovely

Overall crystal is great

implicit returns?
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Crystal.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Crystal.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Crystal.file} lang="crystal" />
### Day 22: [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
bruh why i gotta install erlang anyways...
feels like rust
bruh where is file system (fs) - gleam_erlang remove fs in 0.24? `gleam add simplifile` works ig
no for loops lmao - ig thats the functional bro mindset
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Gleam.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Gleam.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Gleam.file} lang="gleam" />
### Day 23: [Raku](https://raku.org/)
Perl 6 apparently? well happy i aint stuck in the programming of the 90s lmao.
Easy to setup & you can use hashbang lovely
what in the weeb? https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap#Constraint_value_types

holy there are a lot of operators and thingos https://docs.raku.org/language/operators
bruh look at this cursed if statement
```raku
if $visited !(cont) $neighbour and @curr_arr ∌ $neighbour and all @curr_arr>>.&{ %graph{$_} (cont) $neighbour } {}
```
In the [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), you'll see that one of their philosophies is `There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.` Feels like Raku went the opposite direction xD.

overall pretty nice lmao
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Raku.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Raku.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Raku.file} lang="raku" />
### Day 24: [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
feels very much like go - uses runes & ppl in odin discord use go syntax highlighting since odin not supported there
documentation is decent but defs could be better - imited examples
[Odin has non-capturing lambda produres](https://odin-lang.org/docs/faq/#does-odin-have-closures)

haven't made a use after free error in so long until using this lang lmao
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Odin.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Odin.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Odin.file} lang="go" />
### Day 25: [Mojo](https://modular.com/mojo)
Get pranked this is just python with a compiler xD
Looking at the favicon i keep mistaking it for MDN lmao (They are literally the same)
Bruh Mojo Set doesn't work with a string??? Imma use a Dict i guess??
list comprehensions don't work in mojo? Mojo doesn't have `zip` or `filter`
```python
[len("".join(x).replace(c, '')) - 1 for x in list(zip(*a.split("\n")))]
```
is the code meant to convert keys and locks to their corresponding numbers by transposing (unzipping (zip(*))) the strings

Mojo fails to parse

Now I'm angry. Though I'd be happy to manually write this list comprehension imperatively if I was using C, with the expectation that it would be pythonic and not delivering is so sad. Frick this language imma not code for the rest of Christmas

WHy do they have ai art in their page - who's to say they aren't use the trash code that llm's produce 💀. They claim to be open source but using generative ai is stealing so this contradicts the spirit of the initiative.

Hate how you use my_var[] for dereferencing pointers

Functions like String.replace just doesn't work

Worst language
<StarRating rating={aoc24_languages.Mojo.rating} icon={aoc24_languages.Mojo.icon} />
TLDR: Wow I actually wanna use functional code irl
<Solution file={aoc24_languages.Mojo.file} lang="mojo" />
## Conclusion

lets rank these based on nothing but vibes

import Ranking from './Ranking.astro'

<Ranking />

The take away from all of this in regards to languages is that most of them are good enough if they have just existed for long enough to have good documentation.

import LangTree from './LangTree.astro'
