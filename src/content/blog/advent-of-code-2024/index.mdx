## The challenge
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a 25 day challenge of language agnostic problems for the month of December in the lead up to Christmas. The problems can be solved by any means necessary including by hand, on LibreOffice Calc, with Sratch or with a programming language.

I decided that for 2024, I would try and have a crack trying a different language for each day:

import Languages from './Languages.astro';

<Languages />

You can find all of my solutions in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/RiceL123/advent-of-code).
## Visualizing language usage
[GitHub](https://github.com) will automatically generate the language distribution in a repository according to [linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/) which will automatically generate a HTML span like the one below.

import GitHubLangs from './GitHubLangs.astro'

<GitHubLangs />

Though this is great feature, information is aggregated into a single 'Other' category when there are too many different languages in a single repo. So I tried to write a github action workflow that would run a python script on every commit and display the language usage in the README.md file
- Initially i tried to use a python script to generate raw html. However, Although it was working on my own markdown previews, github's README.md files do not render raw HTML elements.
- So the next best option i could think of was to manually redraw an image which would be reflected in the README.md file referencing it
- I had to learn a little bit of MatPlot lib and how the workflow of github's yaml files should be organized (i was only familiar with cd/ci in gitlab from university work)
- The script works find walking through the directory, however, as order didn't matter for showing distribution, the languages might as well be sorted for maximally aesthics (i.e. sorting based on colour (more specifically the hue https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue#Defining_hue_in_terms_of_RGB))

import HueDraft from './HueDraft.astro'

<HueDraft />

- What we find is that this works 
```js
let hue = Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(3) * (G - B), (2 * R - G - B))
```
- The problem with this is that languages like Crystal (Black) and C (Grey) that with colour values which pertain to (r == g == b) will be placed on the colour wheel with no real intent. The best solution I could think of was to convert all the colours to grayscale in order to be able to compare the colours by their value. Then I would insert any whites to the lightest section and any grays / blacks into the darkest parts. However, there is a difference between perceived luminance and value (this is why HSV and HSL are distinct).

```js
let luminance = 0.2126 * R + 0.7152 * G + 0.0722 * B
let value = Math.max(R, G, B)
```

import HueLuminance from './HueLuminance.astro'

<HueLuminance />

Based on vibes, luminence is the better indicator for determining where to put the colours. Now we can just get the darkest colour by luminence and chuck our grays and blacks there.

If more robust colour sorting is wanted in the future, I think I would use both the hue and luminance in my calculation to get to a 2D plot and from there do some [dimensionality reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction) to sort them in 1 dimension.

import ColorScatter from './ColorScatter.astro'

<ColorScatter />

import ColorSorted from './ColorSorted.astro'

<ColorSorted />

## The Languages
What do I want out of a programming language?
- Should be easy to read (meaning it is quite close to english or easy to understand)
- Should have good documentation / hopefully someone has already had the same question on stack overflow (I will try to actively avoid any youtube tutorials because personally I learn better from the docs)
- Plz have IntelliSense but this is fine if the error messages are helpful
- Easy to install / setup - if I can't make it a simple shebangable script at least make it a simple `cargo new` or something
- I don't want to be fighting the language or compiler, i want to be fighting the problem at hand
- specific miscellaneous good to haves: functional paradigm support, lambdas, destructuring, types or type hints

### Day 01: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
Haskell is pretty fun i like
Hoogle good
<StarRating rating={7} icon={aoc24_languages.Haskell.icon} />
TLDR: Functional but i'm not actually a functional bro so unlugs
### Day 02: [Lua](https://www.lua.org/)
There was a lot of hype around Lua. All the youngings be using it for roblox and I also see it in neovim and other random places. Very easy to setup
It was good but I would prefer some more batteries included if you know what i mean. It was really easy to setup very nice

<StarRating rating={3} icon={aoc24_languages.Lua.icon} />

TLDR: not bad good size (literally very small)
### Day 03: [Bash](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/bash/bashtop.html)
Gotta love piping like a maniac

<StarRating rating={8} icon={aoc24_languages.Bash.icon} />
TLDR: Your mother
### Day 04: [Go](https://go.dev/)
Felt like a c kinda solution
### Day 05: [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/)
Love the functional thingos
### Day 06: [C++](https://isocpp.org/)
not bad
### Day 07: [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/)
streams for days - isn't that bad however, i do understand that java has been putting in the work for jdk 17 which is what i was using
### Day 08: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
Is good nothing out of ordinary
### Day 09: [C](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/)
Kinda a scuffed solution but yeah in the end you gotta pay respects to the OG
### Day 10: [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript)
Javascript so nice to use when making simple things. Did this challenge in the airport very nice
might be one of my fav implementations of functional
### Day 11: [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
I'm not too familiar with dp, so I fell back onto a language i was familiar with as a safe guard
Only later did i directly translate this code to scala. It was a pretty simple process. Love that scala supports functional style programs
### Day 12: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
Rust my beloved. The errors are so helpful! awesome documentation! i can't stop glazing rust
### Day 13: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
Ruby is great. When doing some arithmetic, the numbers seemed to be stored as quotients and so I had no floating point errors. It was amazing! Syntatically simple pre nice
### Day 14: [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
There was a lot of hype of
Documentation feels
For some reason vscode IntelliSense not working. All goods cuz it works on Zed with the click of a button

First day of zig not really liking it. Second day of zig liking it a lot more. The learning curve was pretty steepish but after the initial curve pretty lit i reckon

Needa give Zig some time to marinate. Would probably only go back to it if it passes v1.0

I love how the problem is just like 'find the christmas tree that'll appear' without any clear deterministic instructions or examples
### Day 15: [Python](https://www.python.org/)
Bruh zig had me so demotivated
### Day 16: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
Hate how difficult it was just to find the cli compiler like bro i don't want your IDE mate. Bruh binary is just like 200MB and its a pain to setup and run and just running hello world i needa install even more dependencies?? The compilation times are outrageously slow

Doesn't have a standard file system? Maybe its cuz its tryna target multiple platforms - gleam as well?? Wow turns out if i want to just java functions, i can't use the kotlin native compiler but need the jvm compiler?? However, you can't have both the native and jvm compiler as it just default to the native compiler ðŸ˜ . bruh ofc imma click on the linux one if i see it [there](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/releases/tag/v2.1.0)

Kotlin doesn't have a priority queue or min-heap. All goods because I can just drop in the java priority queue which is pretty cool

might be the worst language so far
### Day 17: [Dart](https://dart.dev)
why does apt-get take 4 steps???? bruh imma just download the binary (bruh its like 200 MB as well) (takes less steps lmao)
bruh why is analytics opt-out and not opt-in. typically google ig ðŸ’€
overall pretty nice language, shebangable, destructuring and what not pretty mid nothing too good nothing too bad
### Day 18: [Exilir](https://elixir-lang.org)
Very easy download only taking like 7 mb and easy to pick up syntatically
Functional
shebangable lovely (gives me gleam vibes)
Lmao i've like never seen these vscode colours for keywords before (i just use the default theme cuz i'm a simple guy)
functional bfs is kinda based - I looked up a recusive solution and it didn't seem too bad. However, instead of copying it, I wanted to try and do an unfold

Didn't really understand unfold so played aroud in iex for a bit. Also very nice
docs are pretty good

Overall really liked it: I would like to try 
### Day 19: [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org/)
Squirrel prolly one of the most obscure languages on this list
### Day 20: [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/)
Nim was nice as to code in. I really liked
### Day 21: [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/)
Crystal is ruby like language -
documentation is awesome
some error messages not that helpful
has functional features lovely

Overall crystal is great

implicit returns?
### Day 22: [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)
bruh why i gotta install erlang anyways...
feels like rust
bruh where is file system (fs) - gleam_erlang remove fs in 0.24? `gleam add simplifile` works ig
no for loops lmao - ig thats the functional bro mindset
### Day 23: [Raku](https://raku.org/)
Perl 6 apparently? well happy i aint stuck in the programming of the 90s lmao.
Easy to setup & you can use hashbang lovely
what in the weeb? https://docs.raku.org/language/hashmap#Constraint_value_types

holy there are a lot of operators and thingos https://docs.raku.org/language/operators
bruh look at this cursed if statement
```raku
if $visited !(cont) $neighbour and @curr_arr âˆŒ $neighbour and all @curr_arr>>.&{ %graph{$_} (cont) $neighbour } {}
```
In the [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), you'll see that one of their philosophies is `There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.` Feels like Raku went the opposite direction xD.

overall pretty nice lmao
### Day 24: [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/)
feels very much like go - uses runes & ppl in odin discord use go syntax highlighting since odin not supported there
documentation is decent but defs could be better - imited examples
[Odin has non-capturing lambda produres](https://odin-lang.org/docs/faq/#does-odin-have-closures)

haven't made a use after free error in so long until using this lang lmao
### Day 25: [Mojo](https://www.modular.com/mojo)
Get pranked this is just python with a compiler xD
Looking at the favicon i keep mistaking it for MDN lmao (They are literally the same)
Bruh Mojo Set doesn't work with a string??? Imma use a Dict i guess??
list comprehensions don't work in mojo? Mojo doesn't have `zip` or `filter`
```python
[len("".join(x).replace(c, '')) - 1 for x in list(zip(*a.split("\n")))]
```
is the code meant to convert keys and locks to their corresponding numbers by transposing (unzipping (zip(*))) the strings

Mojo fails to parse

Now I'm angry. Though I'd be happy to manually write this list comprehension imperatively if I was using C, with the expectation that it would be pythonic and not delivering is so sad. Frick this language imma not code for the rest of Christmas

WHy do they have ai art in their page - who's to say they aren't use the trash code that llm's produce ðŸ’€. They claim to be open source but using generative ai is stealing so this contradicts the spirit of the initiative.

Hate how you use my_var[] for dereferencing pointers

Functions like String.replace just doesn't work

Worst language

## Conclusion

lets rank these based on nothing but vibes

import Ranking from './Ranking.astro'

<Ranking />

The take away from all of this in regards to languages is that most of them are good enough if they have just existed for long enough to have good documentation.
