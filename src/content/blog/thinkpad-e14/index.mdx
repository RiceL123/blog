My old laptop broke. It was my beloved high school laptop. We had a couple of rough patches like the blue screens of 2021
but I had to get a new one ggs

It used have a single 256gb ssd with a 50gb windows parition and the rest for debian 12 bookworm on KDE. 

How did I decide on debian?
the cse machines had it in uni so thought that it ought to be a quite reliable.

How did I decide on KDE?
I've been married to Krita since 2021 and so, upon hearing that they were apart of the same group as KDE, of course I had to choose it.

Why did I even keep a windows partition it takes up like 47gb by itself leaving you with no room
Idk lmao just thought it would be funny.

Then valentines day 2025 hit. My laptop slowly but surely died as it would start to randomly glitch, freeze and eventually just not turn on. I tried booting it without the battery and other parts to diagnose the problem. But as uni started to kick in, it was too late for saving. 

debian 12.9 doesn't support realtek RTL8852ce wifi chips out the box
linux mint 22.1 does support it

## First thoughts on the ThinkPad E14 Gen 6
Get this copilot button out of my face
the metal chasis is kinda nice but it attraches finger marks and also makes taking it apart quite the challenge
speaks and lovely
keyboard is standard and good
speakers are a treat compared to my old laptop
Bruh the ethernet cable doesn't work - might needa use my warranty to fix that since its literally been a day. The computer detects that there is a ethernet cable but when I go to plug it in, the computer thinks that nothing is plugged in on debian, linux mint and windows (prolly a hardware issue?)
