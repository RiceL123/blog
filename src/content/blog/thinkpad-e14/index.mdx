## My Ex; ThinkPad E495
I reccomended my younger brother a Thinkpad E490 for highschool and it seemed to work pretty well enough for him. So when my Acer aspire 5 broke in year 12, my requirements were just something that could run OneNote and Discord. I ended up getting basically the same laptop but with an AMD chip being the Thinkpad E495 (refurbisged). It was a $600 and was a downgrade from the aspire 5 in terms of performance, screen and storage.

The switched <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and <kbd>Fn</kbd> keys kinda messed with head for a bit but I got over it pretty quickly. What messed with me the most was the terrible screen. While it was perfectly fine for doing homework and regular browsing, doing digital art on it was a nightmare. The 720p resolution just wasn't doing it for me while the colour inaccuracy made me want to cry at times when the same exported image on my phone would look so different. Additionally, during 2021, the laptop would frequently BSOD and being 30 days out from exams, I would have died if it weren't for Dean clutching up by letting me borrow his laptop.

Although the laptop did have its during my final year of highschool, we managed to work through that rough patch and using it throughout university worked perfectly fine as WSL (windows subsystem for linux) had been a good friend. It did everything I needed however was also kind of showing its age with compile times and the laptop always running hot. So, when I saw windows 11 trying add copilot into the taskbar, I knew it was time to switch over to linux.

I split the 256gb SSD into a 50gb partition for windows (windows itself took up 47gb making it basically useless) and the rest for Debian 12 bookworm with KDE. I decided on Debian because the computers at university were running it giving me the impression that it had to be at least a little reliable. I decided on KDE for the desktop environment because I'd been married to Krita for a while and so, upon hearing they were apart of the KDE group, I had no choice but to choose it.

I would frequently add stickers to my E495, while also getting giving her princess treatment. I upgraded the ram and storage with parts from old laptops, replaced the broken charging cable and when the screen started to chromatic abberate, swapped it for the screen in my brother's e490 (love how easy it is to upon up a Lenovo). I was prolonging my beloved's life but she was moving onto a better place.

## Breakup
I 

My old laptop broke. It was my beloved high school laptop. We had a couple of rough patches like the blue screens of 2021
but I had to get a new one ggs

It used have a single 256gb ssd with a 50gb windows parition and the rest for Debian 12 bookworm on KDE. 

How did I decide on debian?
the cse machines had it in uni so thought that it ought to be a quite reliable.

How did I decide on KDE?
I've been married to Krita since 2021 and so, upon hearing that they were apart of the same group as KDE, of course I had to choose it.

Why did I even keep a windows partition it takes up like 47gb by itself leaving you with no room
Idk lmao just thought it would be funny.

Then valentines day 2025 hit. My laptop slowly but surely died as it would start to randomly glitch, freeze and eventually just not turn on. I tried booting it without the battery and other parts to diagnose the problem. But as uni started to kick in, it was too late for saving. 

debian 12.9 doesn't support realtek RTL8852ce wifi chips out the box
linux mint 22.1 does support it

## First thoughts on the ThinkPad E14 Gen 6
Get this copilot button out of my face
the metal chasis is kinda nice but it attraches finger marks and also makes taking it apart quite the challenge
speaks and lovely
keyboard is standard and good
speakers are a treat compared to my old laptop
Bruh the ethernet cable doesn't work - might needa use my warranty to fix that since its literally been a day. The computer detects that there is a ethernet cable but when I go to plug it in, the computer thinks that nothing is plugged in on debian, linux mint and windows (prolly a hardware issue?)
Don't even use the finger print lmao
touch pad bad
Screen is nice and clear - though just from putting it on my bag once, i could see scratches from the keys and the nipple touching the screen. If you wanna not have your keyboard etched into your screen, you best not push it around too much.
