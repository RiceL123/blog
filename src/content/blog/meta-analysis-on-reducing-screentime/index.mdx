## Intro
My phone screen time is abysmal. Seeing it reach heavenly heights sitting above 4 hours each day produces visceral feelings of disgust. Doing some calculations, we find that
```
(4 hours/day) * (365 day/year)
= 1460 hours / year
= 14600 hours / decade

(4 hours/day) / (24 hours/day - 8 hours/day for sleep) 
= 1/4 of all the waking hours of your life
```
The opportunity cost of all this time spent on these small screens is cataclysmic with the awareness that the majority of these hours consists of doom scrolling on TikTok or Instagram Reels. Fluency in a foreign language, mastery over a new instrument or any other noble endeavour could have been worked towards and yet the allure of instant gratification prevents me from working towards being my best self.

> "Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing" -
> <cite>Dostoyevsky[^1]</cite>

Inherently, I know that I wasn't destined to doom scroll for hours on end and I yet continue on in the way of folly. So, how can I amend this disconnect between what I desire and how I behave?

## The Plan
In the best case scenario, pure mental fortitude would set my mind above the desires of the flesh and effectively crucify any meaningless screen time. However, as my mind is weak, I must reach for external motivators in order to walk in the light. 

The next best solution is then to throw my phone in the sea[^2] however, phone calls, 2FA and the such are essential to daily function. So, empirical research on different methods in reducing aimless screen time was undertaken in order to work towards a reasonable solution.

### Moving the phone charger
One of the biggest facilitators to this mind consuming habit is a non-zero phone battery charge. With my charger right next to my bed, I would endless scroll till my eventual slumber as my phone would charge for the next day. Even one of my mates (Kevin) decided to purchase a 3 metre charging cable to put next to his bed in an act of pure hedonism.

Seeing as a full phone charge was necessary for the next day and having the phone so close to where I slept was detrimental, I decided to experiment with different placements of the phone charger as shown below.

import ChartCharger from './ChartCharger.astro'

<ChartCharger />

It was found that there was a negative correlation between the charger's distance to the bed and the amount of screen time. Once the charging location had reached the critical distance of being outside of the bedroom, any additional distance would provide marginal benefit.

Overall, this experiment does seem to indicate the validity of moving the charging port away from the bed. Furthermore, other benefits like better sleeping habits were also experienced. However, I was able to conjure some excuses like *"I need my phone as an alarm"* and *"it'd be weird to use the common area to charge my phone living in a share house"* despite the success. Remedies like buying a physical alarm clock were deemed as valid[^3] however, I ended up on settling with just putting the charger on the other side of the bedroom.

### Black and White
I saw a friend (Dean) with their phone in gray scale and asked if it had any benefit to reducing screen time. It was indicated that color being taken away would disincentivize phone usage as videos and images would seem more boring. So, from July 2024 to the end of August 2024, I switched my phone to grey monotone. This can be done in the settings app on iOS.

Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Color Filters > Grayscale

import ChartGreyscale from './ChartGreyscale.astro'

<ChartGreyscale />

Initially there was some improvement in decreasing my screen time as I would be constantly reminded why everything was was grayscale whenever I opened my phone. Furthermore, it did have the implicit benefit of making me focus more on values[^4] for my own art studies. Additionally, when taking photos or screenshots, the colour information was kept so that sharing images to others would be of no hassle. Additionally, qr codes and barcodes worked perfectly fine as the `1`s and `0`s weren't affected.

However, sometimes when I would show friends things on my phone or wanted to see colour, I would need to quickly change the deeply nested settings which was quite tedious. Furthermore, overtime, my brain improved at filling in the gaps lacking colour information.

Although grayscale did show some promise while also not holding me back from important tasks, it was slowly losing its effectiveness.

### Inverted Colours
For September of 2024, I landed on the idea of stacking both grayscale and inverted colours together in order to make me hate looking at my phone. Similar to where you find the settings for grayscale, you can turn on inverted colours on iOS through

Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Classic Invert

import ChartInverted from './ChartInverted.astro'

<ChartInverted />

The graph seems to indicate a triumphant victory. Additionally, the days with high screen times were not entirely of mindless activities but rather of development with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app for my [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) course. The replusive colours was so successful in turning me away from the screen that I even started using my physical Bible instead of the app. Additionally, as with grayscale, sharing screen shots and photos to friends worked perfectly fine.

However, there were some real drawbacks like the inability for barcode or qrcode readers to flip `1`s and `0`s back to their correct position. The abhorrent viewing experience also discouraged me from taking any photos or videos as I couldn't tell if the photo looked decent.

Inverting the screen colours is a great method to reducing screen time however, the frustration that comes with toggling it on and off to do some otherwise basic tasks had me yearning for October whereby I would switch back to normal colours.

### Deactivation
Now we are going to hear from Jonathon and his experience with deactiviting certain applications

### Study Strims
Although some of the aforementioned experiments were successful in decreasing phone screen time, it did not necessarily correspond to productive work replacing the extra free time. In fact, I would just spend more time on laptop playing tetris and watching random youtube videos.

import ChartLaptopPhone from './ChartLaptopPhone.astro'

<ChartLaptopPhone />

In the pursuit of reducing my phone screen time, I lost track of the actual goal; to be more productive.

However, I do have a insane technique to being productive; [study strims](https://www.youtube.com/@RiceL123/streams). It is so effective because when I record myself either with my phone or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/), I'm held accountable by the stream to put in the work. When the stream is on, all is well and work is completed for hours on end, but the most difficult part still prevails; actually starting the stream. To combat this, I started drawing thumbnails for the broadcasts as motivation because I enjoy drawing. I would only be allowed to draw if I completed a study strim for the previous drawing resulting in an positive self perpetuating cycle.

Despite the successes of study strims. It is a not silver bullet. One can always just end the stream prematurely and go back to dilly-dallying. Furthermore, if I don't want to draw thumbnails, then I have no motivation to start.

## Conclusion
If I had to give an rating out of 10 for each of the techniques with respect to how it encourages you to be more productive while also considering their pitfalls, it would be as follows;

import ChartOverall from './ChartOverall.astro'

<ChartOverall />

It should be noted that these techniques do not need to be used in isolation. Combining them to better spur you on to productivity is more effective but it should be noted that all these external procedures do not aid in improving one's internal resilience. 

As a parting note and something to think about, future studies specifically targeted at building mental strength could be explored.
