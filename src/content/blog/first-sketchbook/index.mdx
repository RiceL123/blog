## Intro
[This](/sketchbook.jpg) is my first sketchbook that I filled out from Feb of 2024 to Feb 2025.

For context, I started drawing digitally with my wacom tablet from 2021-22. In 2023, however, I dropped it only producing [1 painting](https://www.instagram.com/p/CyilzInSgxF/) at a social event for the entire year. Enter the beginning of 2024. 

My sister was moving places and so when I went to help, I grabbed some stuff she was going to throw out which happened to include some sketching pencils and one of those free notebooks you get at career fairs. As I did all my uni work on my laptop, I had no need for this notebook. But with some inspiration from [Pewidipie](https://youtu.be/MJDtQTTAogk), I thought I would try picking drawing again but traditionally this time.

## The Actual Drawing part
You can find the actual contents of the sketchbook on my YouTube channel linked below.

## Reflections

### Traditional learnings used in digital?
- the power to draw bad
- more confidence
- draw faster
- don't zoom in
- maybe I should be using a pen or something 

### Drawing is gambling?? 
My family used to be rich. We had a beautiful mansion with a Chinese garden spanning more than 15 hectares. Though my grandpa was born in this lucious estate, my great grandma loved to gamble so much so that we became poor. So, I vowed to not ever gamble knowing that in my blood runs the dna lvl 100 gamblers.

How does this apply to drawing? Well, when ever I made a sketch, the sketch itself would be a gamble to see if everything looked good.

### Motivation to drawing
For some some reason my motivation to draw increases as assignment deadlines approach; there is a strong positive correlation between drawing motivation and the number of assignemnt deadlines.

import Motivation from './Motivation.astro'

<Motivation />

Although this graph does show my desire to draw relative to the due date of assignments, why does the motivation drop off right before? Well, the gap represents a change in my mind as I realise how cooked I am for the upcoming assignment and actually start working on it.

Though this graph accurately represents my mind during the school term, as in the back of my mind I believe I should be using all my free time applying for jobs, leetcoding and doing uni work, my mindset during the school holidays changes quite significantly. There is no guilt to draw and it feels like the first sip of a cold pepsi.

### Studying / Drawing for fun
In pursuit of greatness in a lot of human endeavours, one must strike a healthy balance between enjoyment and absolutely locking in. Let's say you want to become a cracked tetris player. You enjoy playing 1v1's however, you have plateaued in skill. In order to improve, you may need to analyze your previous games, do some conditioning like slow cheese race or other kinds of practice however, the practice tastes like cardboard and brings no immediate joy. So you choose to do a balance of practicing and playing inorder to not burn out and quit from only trying to improve and also to not remain in your plateaued state so you can enjoy the fruits of your hard work.

I believe this same approach can be taken to art though finding that balance between practicing and drawing for fun will be different for everyone. For this sketchbook, I was cranking up the drawing purely for enjoyment to the max while neglecting any practice. I was lead purely but my animal instinct of 'I wanna this'. Despite this, I was still able to improve a little bit which was nice to see.

Though I feel like I don't really wanna study something like the hands right now, I can also envision a future where my hard work pays off and I really enjoy drawing them. Maybe I should lock in buy an anatomy book?

I've kinda villainized practice without actually practicing LMAO. As with uni, I will procastinate doing assignments but once I start actually working on them, I regularly come to the realisation that I actually enjoy it. Well, as they say, 'once you've started, you've done half the work'. Possibly with my next sketchbook you'll find some practice.

## Conclusion
Yeah nah sketchbooks are awesome. To me they are be a place to experiment and have fun. I've seen some other people's sketchbooks where they tape / glue things into it. I didn't even know you could do that. Thats pretty lit lmao.
